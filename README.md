SDE Frontend Assignment

This project is the frontend UI implementation based on the reference video provided in the assignment. The goal of this project was to accurately recreate the layout, colors, spacing, typography, and overall visual structure shown in the reference. The UI is fully responsive and works on both desktop and mobile screen sizes. Smooth transitions and basic UI animations are included for a better user experience.

Tech Stack Used:
React.js for building the UI components, Tailwind CSS for styling and responsive design, Vite for fast development environment, and basic CSS transitions for animations.

Project Structure (Simple Overview):
The src folder contains all the main code. Inside it, there is a components folder for reusable UI components, an assets folder for images or icons, and files like App.jsx and main.jsx which are used to render the application. Styles are applied using Tailwind classes directly in JSX.

Responsiveness:
Tailwind CSS responsive classes (like sm, md, lg, and xl) are used to adjust the layout depending on the screen size. The UI automatically rearranges elements to fit small screens (like mobile) and large screens (like desktop).
